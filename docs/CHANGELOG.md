### Session state persistence (#55)

- Rust `SessionStore` remains the source of truth for live session UI layout via `layout_set` / attach (host `localStorage` is a cache). Layout blob is now **v4**.
- Reattach / reload / `/?token=` restores **multiple** terminal tabs (and splits) by partitioning live PTY ids, reopens **editor** tabs by path, and stamps leaf **cwd** into the pane tree.
- Explorer expanded folders + scroll are kept **per view-root cwd** when switching terminals (and persisted in the layout blob). Semantics follow Fresh `FileExplorerState`; Fresh workspace disk files are not used on the ADE path.
- `ui.fontWeight` / chrome typography apply immediately on settings save (CSS vars on tabs, sidebar, tree, status) without a page reload; terminal glyph refresh also runs after mono weight changes.
- Explicit `fresh-gui close` still ends the daemon and clears session persistence.

### Markdown WYSIWYG (#52)

- Markdown preview mode (`Mod+Shift+V`) is now an editable WYSIWYG surface with a formatting toolbar (bold/italic/strike/code, headings, lists, quote, code block, link, HR).
- Edits serialize to GFM markdown (Turndown + GFM plugin) and update the CodeMirror buffer so save / dirty / ADE CAS keep working.
- KaTeX and Mermaid blocks stay atomic in the preview; double-click edits their source. Task-list checkboxes are interactive.
- Keyboard shortcuts in the WYSIWYG surface: `Mod+B` / `Mod+I` / `Mod+K` / `Mod+Shift+E` (inline code).
- Fresh’s Compose/Page View plugin was checked first; it is not available on the ADE path (`runtime` only, plugins off, terminal-cell rendering), so the host preview owns this UX.
